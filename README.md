# Game Logics:
- There are *3 Powerups*: ´´´Heal Orb´´´, ´´´Speed Orb´´´ and ´´´Strength Orb´´´
- You can only have one Powerup at a time
- You consume them by using Action Key : ´´´Q´´´
- Once You consume an Orb you get the desired Effect
- The Project uses the New Input System
- The ´´´BlockBreaker.exe´´´ can be found in the ´´´Build/Windows/´´´ Folder
- When You reach the final room You see a win screen displaying your score and your locally stored highscore
- The ´´´HUD´´´ consists of 3 parts: ´´´DebugBox´´´ (with things like Countdown, Score, Room, Stage, Damage, etc.), ´´´Healthbar´´´ (including current Powerup and its details) and ´´´Effect Display´´´ (with the cureent effect and remaining timer)
- There are 3 ´´´Enemy Spawner´´´ types: ´´´Standing´´´ (unused), ´´´Running´´´ (with variable speed) and ´´´Watching´´´ (walks to You and starts running at close range)
- Once The Enemies hit You, You loose Health
- When You die or win, the game displays a win/loose screen and restarts the game after 5 seconds
